*Note: This traceability matrix covers all test cases for US-CHR-001 through US-CHR-007. All previously blocked test cases (TC-CHR-020, TC-CHR-043, TC-CHR-049, TC-CHR-063) have been unblocked by the delivery of US-CHR-001. BR-5 for US-CHR-002 (HR approval for sensitive field edits) is deferred as it depends on tenant-configurable approval workflows not yet implemented. For US-CHR-003, BR-2 (manager reporting chain scope) is deferred pending Employee.ReportsToEmployeeId and BR-5 search is implemented as ILIKE with tsvector upgrade path documented. US-CHR-007 adds 24 test cases (20 functional/security/performance/accessibility/cross-browser + 4 dedicated multi-tenant isolation) with 100% coverage of all 4 ACs, 8 FRs, 4 NFRs, and 6 BRs. The matrix will be extended as additional Core HR user stories (US-CHR-008+) and other modules are authored.*
